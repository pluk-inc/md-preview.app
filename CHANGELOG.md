# Changelog

## [0.0.7] – 2026-05-03

YAML frontmatter rendering fix and Inspector metadata.

- **YAML frontmatter no longer collapses into a giant heading.** The CommonMark renderer was treating the closing `---` of a frontmatter block as a setext heading underline, turning `title:` / `date:` / `tags:` into one oversized H2 at the top of the document. The block is now stripped before parsing and the preview matches what GitHub, Obsidian, and VS Code show.
- **Frontmatter shows up in the Inspector.** A new **Properties** section at the top of the Inspector lists each key/value pair from the document's frontmatter, so the metadata is one click away even though it's hidden from the rendered preview. The Quick Look extension hides it too.
- **Word, line, and heading counts now reflect body content.** The Inspector's stats no longer include the frontmatter block in their totals.

## [0.0.6] – 2026-05-02

Toolbar, banner, and table-of-contents polish.

- **Search field collapses to a magnifying-glass button in narrow windows.** When the toolbar is too tight to fit the expanded search field, it now folds into an icon-only button matching the rest of the toolbar instead of being clipped.
- **Open With toolbar item shows the resolved editor.** When a default Markdown editor is set, the toolbar item now reads "Open in <Editor>" as both label and tooltip, and the menu lists apps by their Finder display name without the `.app` suffix. The chosen editor's location is also remembered alongside its bundle ID, so launches still resolve when the bundle ID is unavailable.
- **Folder-access banner no longer clips text on macOS 15.** The banner now advertises a fixed height to the titlebar accessory so descenders in the message label aren't cut off, and the redundant top/bottom separators are hidden on macOS 15 (where AppKit already draws system ones).
- **Folder-access banner stays until access is granted.** Removed the dismiss button so the prompt no longer disappears when accidentally clicked — it now goes away only after you grant read access to the folder.
- **TOC clicks scroll headings below the toolbar.** Jumping to a heading from the sidebar now accounts for the toolbar height plus a small breathing margin, so the target heading lands in view instead of behind the toolbar.
- **Share toolbar button is the right size.** The share item no longer renders an oversized icon next to the other toolbar buttons.

## [0.0.5] – 2026-05-02

Small fullscreen polish for the sidebar.

- **Sidebar title sits correctly in fullscreen.** The document title at the top of the table-of-contents pane no longer slides under the toolbar when the window enters fullscreen — it now anchors to the safe-area inset and stays put in both windowed and fullscreen modes.

## [0.0.4] – 2026-05-02

Relative images and links in Markdown files now render in the sandboxed app.

- **Render relative local assets via a folder-access banner.** When a document references images or files alongside it, Markdown Preview now shows an in-window banner offering to grant read access to the parent folder. Once granted, the access is remembered across launches and assets load through a dedicated `md-asset://` scheme so they appear inline in the preview.
- **Stable DMG filename for GitHub releases.** The DMG attached to each GitHub release is now `Markdown-Preview.dmg` without a version suffix, so download links stay valid across versions.

## [0.0.3] – 2026-05-02

Better Markdown rendering and a tidier **Open With** menu.

- **Switched the Markdown engine to swift-markdown (cmark-gfm).** Rendering is now CommonMark- and GitHub-Flavored-Markdown-compliant, so tables, task lists, strikethrough, and autolinks render the way you'd expect on GitHub.
- **Fixed the Open With list.** No more duplicate Markdown Preview entries from old build copies, and unrelated apps that only claim a generic plain-text association no longer show up — only apps that actually edit Markdown are listed.

## [0.0.2] – 2026-05-01

Compatibility release: Markdown Preview now runs on macOS 15 Sequoia in addition to macOS 26 Tahoe.

- **Lowered the minimum macOS version to 15.0 (Sequoia).** Previously required macOS 26 Tahoe.
- **Replaced the app icon with an Icon Composer `.icon` bundle.** Fixes the icon appearing oversized on Sequoia — the system now applies its own mask and the standard safe-area inset.

## [0.0.1] – 2026-04-30

First public build of Markdown Preview — a fast, native macOS reader for `.md` files.

### Highlights

- In-document search via the toolbar field plus standard `⌘F` / `⌘G` / `⌘⇧G`
